# Chrome Extension Boilerplate with React 17 and Webpack 5

The following project is built using the boilerplate https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate.

The boilerplate provided in the assignment pdf didn't work

## Features

This is a basic Chrome Extensions boilerplate to help you write modular and modern Javascript code, load CSS easily and [automatic reload the browser on code changes](https://webpack.github.io/docs/webpack-dev-server.html#automatic-refresh).

This boilerplate is updated with:

- [Chrome Extension Manifest V3](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-overview/)
- [React 17](https://reactjs.org)
- [Webpack 5](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Webpack Dev Server 4](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)
- [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)
- [eslint-config-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-config-react-app)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

This boilerplate is heavily inspired by and adapted from [https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate](https://github.com/samuelsimoes/chrome-extension-webpack-boilerplate), with additional support for React 17 features, Webpack 5, and Webpack Dev Server 4.

Please open up an issue to nudge me to keep the npm packages up-to-date. FYI, it takes time to make different packages with different versions work together nicely.

## Installing and Running

### Procedures:

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
2. Run `npm start`

   1. Access `chrome://extensions/`

4. Happy hacking.
